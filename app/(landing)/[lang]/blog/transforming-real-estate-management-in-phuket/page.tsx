      <p>In the picturesque setting of Phuket, Thailand, WME Solutions recently brought our consulting expertise directly to Empire Estates’ headquarters. This hands-on, immersive experience was led by our Senior Implementation Specialist, Kessi Adhjari, whose deep knowledge of [Monday.com](http://monday.com/) was instrumental in helping Empire Estates realize the platform’s full potential as their primary operational tool. Joined by Junior Implementation Specialist Chan Khine and CEO Eddy Azoulay, the WME Solutions team collaborated closely with Empire Estates to streamline and elevate their property management processes.</p>
      <br/>
      <h3><b>Building a Foundation for Success: Kessi’s Hands-On Guidance</b></h3>
      <p>Empire Estates’ team, including owner Silvain and his colleague Patama, shared their daily challenges in managing multiple properties, tenants, and maintenance schedules. Kessi listened carefully, identifying key areas where Monday.com could reduce friction and bring clarity to their workflow. Guided by her expertise, the WME Solutions team began developing customized workflows to automate processes, reduce manual tasks, and enhance team coordination.</p>

      <br/>
      <p>With Chan providing support, Kessi led the Empire Estates team through each step of the setup process, transforming their business needs into tailored workflows on Monday.com. From automated follow-ups to task boards, they co-created an organized, efficient system that would replace hours of manual work with just a few clicks. For Chan, this experience was also a valuable opportunity to apply her skills in a real-world client setting and learn the nuances of hands-on consulting.</p>
      <br/>
      <h3><b>Seeing the Big Picture: Visualizing Success with Dashboards</b></h3>
    <p>Later, Kessi guided the Empire Estates team in understanding how to visualize data for actionable insights. Inviting Silvain and Patana to gather around a large monitor, Kessi presented a custom dashboard showcasing Empire Estates’ essential metrics—property occupancy rates, task statuses, and maintenance timelines—all in real-time.</p>

    <br/>
    <p>“This is where all your hard work comes together,” Kessi explained as she walked through the dashboard’s features, highlighting how visualizing their data in this format could streamline decision-making. The dashboard was a revelation for the Empire Estates team, offering them a centralized view of their operations and replacing the need to search through spreadsheets for updates. By the end, the excitement in the room was palpable—Empire Estates now had a powerful tool to drive their business forward.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3><b>A Team Effort: Growing Together</b></h3>
<p>This on-site consultation wasn’t just about introducing a tool; it was about building a partnership. For WME Solutions, the day also underscored our commitment to empowering clients through personalized solutions. For Junior Implementation Specialist Chan, the session provided invaluable learning—working side-by-side with Kessi allowed her to develop his consulting skills and gain firsthand experience in solving real-world challenges.</p>
