He always made the effort to fit me in last minute, and took the time to explain each process with me when I didn't understand something.

        "I hired Eddy to help me out with setting up Monday.com. He was super helpful, and a really great hire. I highly recommend him. Eddy is exceptionally well informed about Monday.com, I was impressed by how up-to-date his knowledge is. He was even able to tell me what features are coming soon in updates. He was easy to work with, patient, and a very good communicator. He answered all my questions and showed me some things I didn't even know I needed to know. I'm very glad that I hired him, I feel that our brief time together saved me hours of trying to figure things out on my own. I do look forward to working with him again, as my Monday.com needs grow.",
