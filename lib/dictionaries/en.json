        ]
      },
      {
        "title": "Why is there a validity period in the packages you offer?",
        "content": "The main purpose of having a validity period is to get things done. While things are fresh in our minds, it is important to keep things going and not let the clock run out without any action. Let’s put it this way, we all value our time and if we were to pause working on a project multiple times or for a long period of time, it would be very time-consuming to get all stakeholders on the same page we were when we paused the project. Even if we have notes and mapped your entire process, this is not ideal. This is part of the WME Solutions success method for all the implementations we have made. We just need a bit of your time each week to review what we have built, participate in collaborative build sessions. Most of our clients enjoy it very much as they feel empowered with the platform and solution that is being built. This method will benefit you in the long run, increase adoption rate. Exception to the Rule: With the Comprehensive and Ultimate package, you are allowed to pause the validity once and up to 1 month. This can come in useful for events occurring such as a company audit to prepare, key stakeholder on holidays, or any unexpected events that could justify pausing the work we have started."
      },
      {
        "title": "How long will it take you to build my workflow on monday.com?",
        "content": "The timeframe will depend on the complexity of your workflow, the number of boards, dashboards, and automations that are involved. On average, we spend 40 to 50 hours per client building advanced workflows, but this can vary significantly depending on your requirements. Some simple workflows will take less than 20 hours’ time while some very advanced ones can take over 100 hours. Book a free Discovery Call so that we can give you a more accurate estimate."
      },
      {
        "title": "What if I do not use all the hours in my package, can I get a refund?",
        "content": "Unused hours in your package are non-refundable but can be used for support & maintenance, workflow review, or training sessions. Once your workflow is built, this is the exciting part, your team can start using it but having a regular review of how the workflow is used by your team by one of our expert consultants is an important part of the adoption part. You can convert your unused hours to Ongoing Support on the basis of 4 hours = 1 month of Review & Support package."

      {
        "title": "Do you have fixed price projects?",
        "content": "Currently not. We find the fixed price model to be rigid when building a custom-made solution on monday.com. Great ideas often emerge during our collaborative building sessions, and you might want to make some changes on what was agreed initially. This is why we prefer the hourly model as it gives more flexibility to our clients, and you can see in full transparency where our time is spent building your solution."

        "title": "Can I cancel the PAYG package at any time?",
        "content": "Yes, you can cancel anytime with 1 month’s notice. The retainer and used hours are non-refundable, but unused hours from your last billing cycle remain usable."

Kessi listened carefully, identifying key areas where Monday.com could reduce friction and bring clarity to their workflow. Guided by her expertise, the WME Solutions team began developing customized workflows to automate processes, reduce manual tasks, and enhance team coordination.</p><br/><img src=\"/blog/transforming-real-estate-management-in-phuket/image1.jpg\" /><br/><p>With Chan providing support, Kessi led the Empire Estates team through each step of the setup process, transforming their business needs into tailored workflows on Monday.com.

The dashboard was a revelation for the Empire Estates team, offering them a centralized view of their operations and replacing the need to search through spreadsheets for updates. By the end, the excitement in the room was palpable—Empire Estates now had a powerful tool to drive their business forward.</p><br/><h3><b>A Team Effort: Growing Together</b></h3><p>This on-site consultation wasn’t just about introducing a tool; it was about building a partnership.
